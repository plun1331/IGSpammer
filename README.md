# How to Use
Simply clone the repository, put your username & password in the `config.ini` file, and then the path to `geckodriver.exe` and your FireFox excecutable in the `files.ini` file. Then, simply excecute `main.py`!

And yes, this only supports FireFox. If you want to use this with other browsers, either go find something else or modify the code. It would also help if you could create a pull request with the modified code, allowing me to make it public on the repository for other users to use.
